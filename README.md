# MiniShogi

Testing: In the repo, there is BoxShogi.jar and the .command file, which should be in the same directory when the test runner is executed.
The .command file directly invokes the runnable jar file (the command is java -jar BoxShogi.jar -f).

This project allows for two human players to play a game of MiniShogi in interactive mode (with flag -i) or allows for the running of a script with prewritten movement commands (-f).
